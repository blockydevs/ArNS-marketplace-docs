# Cancelling an auction

- Status: Discussion ðŸ’¡

## Context and Problem Statement

In the ArNS Marketplace running on AO, auctions (both Dutch and English) are smart contract processes executed entirely within AO compute. Currently, the marketplace enables sellers to list assets (e.g. ANT tokens) for sale, but the mechanism for cancelling an active auction has not yet been finalized.

There are multiple ways an auction cancellation could be handled â€” ranging from issuing a specific cancel message to invoking state expiration or token recall. This decision impacts both user experience and protocol trust guarantees.

We need to define:
- How a seller can cancel their own auction.
- What the exact technical flow is (within AO and ANT).
- How we prevent abuse or unintended cancellations.
- Whether cancellation should emit a protocol-level event.
